      <h1 class="profileHead">About Ian Waddle</h1>
      <p class="lead">I am currently working towards an Associate's of Applied Science of Computer Information Science at Ozarks Technical Community College.
</p>
        <p>I am at the close of my first semester there, and I am looking forward to the next semesters to come. Next semester, spring 2022, I will take Website Development 2, C# Programming, Technical Writing, Introduction to Physics, and College Accounting.  I'm eager to finish college and get it out into the world in get my career started.  I plan to graduate after the semester of Fall 2023, along with my wife, Alli, who will graduate from Missouri State University with a degree in Graphic Design.
I love solving problems and learning about the next new thing.  I currently work at a construction company, helping run their warehouse. Right now, I'm helping them develop a new system to inventory and track equipment as it goes out to jobs across southwestern Missouri.  I believe that I've always been a more practical oriented person, however marrying a graphic designer has really begin to rub off on me- I find myself often thinking about color pallets and font options when working on a project.

  <p>Before I started this semester at OTC, I had never coded before.  However, I was already very familar
  with computer hardware.  In all honesty, I was really intimidated by the thought of programming, but I ended up finding something I really enjoy doing. </p>

        My Interests
      </h2>
      <p class="lead">I love solving problems.</p>
      <p>My absolute favorite hobby is working on my truck.  Though it usually means something has gone wrong,
      I love the challenge of making it run right again.  Theres a special feeling I get once its all put back together and
    I can take a step back and look at the new part making the truck whole again.</p>
